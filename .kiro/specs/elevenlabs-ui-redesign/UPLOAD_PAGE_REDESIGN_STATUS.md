# Upload Page Redesign - Current Status

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Created ElevenLabs Design Reference Document**
   - Captured screenshots of ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text and Sound Effects pages
   - Documented complete design specifications including:
     - Layout structure and dimensions
     - Color palette (blacks, grays, accent colors)
     - Typography system (font sizes, weights, line heights)
     - Spacing system (8px base unit)
     - Component specifications (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
     - Animation patterns and transitions
     - Accessibility guidelines

2. **Identified Key Design Elements to Replicate**
   - Category cards with horizontal scroll (like Sound Effects categories)
   - Clean upload drop zone with dashed border
   - Fixed bottom action bar with full-width CTA button
   - Minimal, clean aesthetic with ample white space
   - Black primary buttons on white background
   - Proper icon sizing and spacing

## Current Issue

The UploadPage.vue file appears to be corrupted or empty (0 lines). The page is rendering but likely using cached/old code.

## Next Steps to Complete

1. **Fix the UploadPage.vue file**
   - The file needs to be properly recreated with the complete ElevenLabs-style design
   - Ensure proper icon sizes (16-24px for inline, 40-48px for large icons)
   - Fix button styling to match ElevenLabs specifications
   - Ensure proper spacing and padding throughout

2. **Key Design Specifications to Apply**

## Recommendation

The UploadPage.vue file needs to be recreated from scratch using the design reference document. The file should be built incrementally to avoid corruption issues.
