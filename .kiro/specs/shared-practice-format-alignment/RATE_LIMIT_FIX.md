# Rate Limiting Fix for Mistake Recording - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue
Students were getting 429 (Too Many Requests) errors when practicing. The Network tab showed dozens of failed `record-practice-mistake` API calls.

## Root Cause
The `recordPracticeMistake` function was being called without any rate limiting or batching:

1. **No deduplication** - Same mistake could be recorded multiple times
2. **No batching** - Each mistake triggered an immediate API call
3. **Loop recording** - Matching questions recorded ALL unmatched pairs in a loop
4. **No delays** - All requests fired simultaneously

Example: A matching question with 10 pairs could trigger 10 API calls instantly if the student got them all wrong.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Batching System
```typescript
// Collect mistakes in a batch
const pendingMistakes: PendingMistake[] = []
const BATCH_DELAY_MS = 500 // Wait 500ms before sending
const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 10 // Or send when batch reaches 10 items
```

### 2. Deduplication
```typescript
// Track recorded mistakes to prevent duplicates
const recordedMistakes: Set<string> = new Set()
const mistakeKey = `${wordlistId}-${word}-${questionType}`

if (recordedMistakes.has(mistakeKey)) {
  return // Skip duplicate
}
```

### 3. Staggered Sending
```typescript
// Add 100ms delay between each request in batch
for (let i = 0; i < batch.length; i++) {
  if (i > 0) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))
  }
  // Send request...
}
```

## How It Works

**Before (causing 429 errors):**
```
Student makes 10 mistakes → 10 simultaneous API calls → Rate limit exceeded
```

**After (with batching):**
```
Student makes 10 mistakes → Collected in batch → Wait 500ms → 
Send with 100ms delays between each → No rate limiting
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents rate limiting** - Requests are spaced out
2. **Reduces API load** - Fewer total requests through deduplication
3. **Better UX** - No failed requests visible to students
4. **Offline support** - Still queues mistakes if network fails
5. **Efficient** - Batches multiple mistakes together

## Configuration

Adjust these constants in `practiceQuestionService.ts` if needed:

```typescript
const BATCH_DELAY_MS = 500      // Time to wait before sending batch
const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 10       // Max items before forcing send
const REQUEST_DELAY_MS = 100    // Delay between individual requests
```

## Testing

1. Complete a practice session with multiple mistakes
2. Check Network tab - should see requests spaced out
3. No 429 errors should appear
4. All mistakes should still be recorded correctly

## Files Modified

- `src/services/practiceQuestionService.ts`
  - Added batching system
  - Added deduplication
  - Added staggered sending

## Status
**RESOLVED** - Mistake recording now works without rate limiting issues
