# Wordlist Disappearing Fix - Spec Completion Summary

## Overview
**Spec**: Wordlist Disappearing Fix  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Completion Date**: January 13, 2025

---

## Problem Statement

Users were experiencing a "Failed to Load Practice Session" error when trying to start practice sessions. The practice questions would disappear immediately after generation, preventing users from practicing their vocabulary.

### Root Cause
The `usePracticeSession` composable was being initialized with empty mock data before questions were generated, causing the session to have no questions to display.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Core Fix
Changed the initialization flow to:
1. **Generate questions FIRST** using `generatePracticeQuestions()`
2. **Create complete PracticeSet** with all generated questions
3. **Initialize composable** with complete data
4. **Transition to active state** only after everything is ready

### Key Changes
- Proper sequencing of async operations
- Complete data passed to composable
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading progress feedback

---

## Before vs After

### Before (Broken) ❌
```typescript
// Initialize with empty mock data
const mockPracticeSet = { questions: [] }
const session = usePracticeSession({ practiceSet: mockPracticeSet })

// Generate questions (but never use them)
const questions = await generatePracticeQuestions(...)

// Session still has empty questions!
// Result: "Failed to Load Practice Session" error
```

### After (Fixed) ✅
```typescript
// 1. Generate questions FIRST
const response = await generatePracticeQuestions(...)

// 2. Create complete PracticeSet with real data
const practiceSet = {
  id: response.practiceSetId,
  questions: response.questions,
  createdAt: new Date(),
  isShared: false
}

// 3. Initialize composable with complete data
const session = usePracticeSession({ practiceSet })

// 4. Transition to active state
practiceState.value = 'active'

// Result: Practice session loads successfully! ✅
```
