# Task 6 Completion: Build CategoryCard Component

## Summary

Successfully implemented the CategoryCard component with all required features including aesthetic backgrounds, hover interactions, responsive grid layout, keyboard accessibility, and lazy loading support.

## Completed Subtasks

### 6.1 Create CategoryCard component structure ✅
- Created `src/components/ui/CategoryCard.vue` with full TypeScript support
- Implemented props interface: `title`, `description`, `image`, `gradient`, `onClick`
- Set 16:9 aspect ratio using CSS `aspect-ratio` property
- Applied 12px border radius using design tokens
- Added semi-transparent gradient overlay for text readability

### 6.2 Implement CategoryCard interactions ✅
- Hover state with `scale(1.02)` transform
- Shadow increase on hover (from `md` to `lg`)
- 200ms transition duration with ease-out easing
- Active state with `scale(0.98)` for click feedback
- Focus state with accent color outline for accessibility

### 6.3 Add CategoryCard responsive grid ✅
- Created `CategoryCardDemo.vue` demonstrating responsive grid layout
- Grid columns: 1 (mobile) → 2 (tablet) → 3 (desktop) → 4 (large desktop)
- Consistent spacing: 16px (mobile), 20px (tablet), 24px (desktop)
- Full keyboard accessibility with Tab navigation and Enter/Space activation
- Native lazy loading support for images using `loading="lazy"` attribute

## Files Created

1. **src/components/ui/CategoryCard.vue** - Main component
   - Props interface with TypeScript
   - Responsive styling with design tokens
   - Keyboard and screen reader accessibility
   - Support for both image and gradient backgrounds

2. **src/components/ui/CategoryCardDemo.vue** - Demo component
   - Responsive grid layout example
   - 4 sample category cards with gradients
   - Click feedback demonstration

3. **src/components/ui/CategoryCard.test.ts** - Comprehensive tests
   - 20 test cases covering all requirements
   - Component structure tests (Requirement 3.1)
   - Interaction tests (Requirement 3.2)
   - Keyboard accessibility tests (Requirement 3.3)
   - Responsive design tests

4. **src/components/ui/index.ts** - Updated exports
   - Added CategoryCard to component library exports

## Test Results

All 20 tests passing:
- ✅ Component Structure (8 tests)
- ✅ Interactions (6 tests)
- ✅ Keyboard Accessibility (5 tests)
- ✅ Responsive Design (1 test)

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 3.1: Category Cards with Aesthetic Backgrounds ✅
- ✅ Aesthetic background images or gradients
- ✅ Overlay text with proper contrast
- ✅ Consistent card dimensions (16:9 aspect ratio)
- ✅ Border radius of 12px

### Requirement 3.2: Hover Interactions ✅
- ✅ Scale transform (1.02) on hover
- ✅ Shadow increase on hover
- ✅ Smooth transitions (200ms)

### Requirement 3.3: Responsive Grid Layout ✅
- ✅ Responsive grid (1-4 columns based on viewport)
- ✅ Consistent spacing (16-24px)
- ✅ Keyboard accessible

### Requirement 3.4: Image Optimization ✅
- ✅ High-quality image support
- ✅ Subtle overlays for text readability
- ✅ Lazy loading support

## Key Features

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML with `role="button"`
- Proper `tabindex` management (0 for clickable, -1 for non-clickable)
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- `aria-hidden` on decorative elements
- Keyboard navigation (Enter/Space activation)
- Focus indicators meeting WCAG AA standards

### Performance
- Native lazy loading for images (`loading="lazy"`)
- GPU-accelerated transforms
- Efficient CSS transitions
- No JavaScript animations for hover states

### Design System Integration
- Uses centralized design tokens
- Consistent with ElevenLabs aesthetic
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Mobile-first approach

### Developer Experience
- Full TypeScript support
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear prop interface
- Reusable demo component
- Exported from component library

## Usage Example

```vue
<template>
  <div class="category-grid">
    <CategoryCard
      title="Upload Document"
      description="Extract vocabulary from your documents"
      gradient="linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)"
      :onClick="handleUpload"
    />
    
    <CategoryCard
      title="Saved Wordlists"
      description="Access your saved vocabulary lists"
      image="https://example.com/wordlists.jpg"
      :onClick="handleWordlists"
    />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { CategoryCard } from '@/components/ui'

const handleUpload = () => {
  console.log('Navigate to upload')
}

const handleWordlists = () => {
  console.log('Navigate to wordlists')
}
</script>

<style scoped>
.category-grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 24px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
}
</style>
```

## Next Steps

The CategoryCard component is ready for integration into the application:

1. **Task 9**: Add CategoryCard components to HomePage
   - Replace or enhance existing navigation with category cards
   - Use aesthetic gradients for "Upload Document" and "Saved Wordlists"
   - Implement navigation on card click

2. **Future Enhancements** (Optional):
   - Add animation on card appearance (fade-in, slide-up)
   - Support for badge/notification indicators
   - Support for icon overlays
   - Dark mode color adjustments

## Technical Notes

- Component uses Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Styling uses scoped CSS with design token bindings
- Images use native lazy loading (no external library needed)
- Grid layout uses CSS Grid with `auto-fit` for flexibility
- All interactive states handled with CSS (no JavaScript overhead)

## Verification

To verify the implementation:

1. Run tests: `pnpm test CategoryCard.test.ts`
2. View demo: Import `CategoryCardDemo.vue` in your app
3. Check accessibility: Test with keyboard navigation and screen reader
4. Test responsive: Resize browser to see grid adapt
