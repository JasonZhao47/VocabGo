# Requirements Document: ElevenLabs Navigation & List Component Enhancement

## Introduction

This feature enhances VocabGo with sophisticated navigation and list components inspired by ElevenLabs.io's actual interface. The goal is to implement a professional sidebar navigation system, elegant list displays with action buttons, and aesthetic category cards with background images. These components will elevate the user experience with clean, modern patterns that match ElevenLabs' production-quality design.
