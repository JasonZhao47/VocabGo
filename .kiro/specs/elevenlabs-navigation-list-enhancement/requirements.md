# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing VocabGo's navigation and list components to match the aesthetic and interaction patterns of ElevenLabs.io. The enhancement focuses on creating a sophisticated, modern interface with smooth interactions, elegant visual hierarchy, and professional polish that aligns with S-tier SaaS design standards.

Based on analysis of ElevenLabs' interface, the key areas of focus are:
1. **Left sidebar navigation** with collapsible sections and visual hierarchy
2. **List/table components** with action buttons and hover states
3. **Category cards** with aesthetic background images
4. **Consistent spacing, typography, and color system**

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Left Sidebar Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a polished left sidebar navigation that provides clear visual hierarchy and smooth interactions, so that I can efficiently navigate between different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a left sidebar with consistent width (240-280px) and dark background
2. WHEN the user views the sidebar THEN the system SHALL display navigation items with:
   - Icon + text label layout
   - Clear visual hierarchy using font weights and spacing
   - Hover states with subtle background color changes
   - Active state with accent color indicator
3. WHEN navigation items have sub-sections THEN the system SHALL support collapsible/expandable groups with smooth animations
4. WHEN the user hovers over navigation items THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with transition duration of 150-200ms
5. WHEN the sidebar contains multiple sections THEN the system SHALL use visual separators (subtle borders or spacing) to group related items
6. WHEN the user is on a specific page THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding navigation item with an accent color or background

### Requirement 2: Modern List/Table Component with Action Buttons

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my wordlists in a clean, organized table with clear action buttons, so that I can easily manage and interact with my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the wordlists page THEN the system SHALL display items in a table/list format with:
   - Clear column headers (Description, Date, Actions)
   - Consistent row height (48-56px minimum)
   - Subtle row separators (1px border with low opacity)
   - Zebra striping or hover states for better scannability
2. WHEN the user hovers over a list item THEN the system SHALL:
   - Apply a subtle background color change
   - Reveal or emphasize action buttons
   - Use smooth transitions (150-200ms)
3. WHEN action buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL:
   - Use icon-only buttons for common actions (download, delete, share)
   - Position buttons in a consistent "Actions" column on the right
   - Apply hover states with scale or color changes
   - Use tooltips to clarify button functions
4. WHEN the user clicks an action button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (scale, color change, or loading state)
5. WHEN the list is empty THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with helpful guidance
6. WHEN the list contains many items THEN the system SHALL support pagination or infinite scroll with loading indicators

### Requirement 3: Category Cards with Aesthetic Backgrounds

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visually appealing category cards that help me quickly identify and navigate to different sections, so that the interface feels modern and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views a page with categories THEN the system SHALL display cards with:
   - Aesthetic background images or gradients
   - Overlay text with proper contrast (using semi-transparent overlays if needed)
   - Consistent card dimensions and aspect ratios
   - Border radius of 8-12px for modern appearance
2. WHEN the user hovers over a category card THEN the system SHALL:
   - Apply a subtle scale transform (1.02-1.05)
   - Increase shadow or glow effect
   - Use smooth transitions (200-300ms)
3. WHEN category cards are displayed in a grid THEN the system SHALL:
   - Use responsive grid layout (2-4 columns based on viewport)
   - Maintain consistent spacing between cards (16-24px)
   - Ensure cards are keyboard accessible
4. WHEN a category card has an image background THEN the system SHALL:
   - Use high-quality images with proper optimization
   - Apply subtle overlays to ensure text readability
   - Support lazy loading for performance

### Requirement 4: Consistent Design System Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to feel cohesive and professional throughout, so that my experience is seamless and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component is rendered THEN the system SHALL use consistent:
   - Color palette (primary, secondary, neutral scales, semantic colors)
   - Typography scale (H1-H4, body text, captions)
   - Spacing units (8px base unit, multiples for all spacing)
   - Border radii (4-6px for small elements, 8-12px for cards)
2. WHEN interactive elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL:
   - Use consistent hover states across all buttons and links
   - Apply focus states that meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
   - Provide disabled states with reduced opacity (0.4-0.6)
3. WHEN animations are used THEN the system SHALL:
   - Keep durations between 150-300ms for micro-interactions
   - Use appropriate easing functions (ease-in-out for most cases)
   - Respect user's motion preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL:
   - Use appropriate color adjustments for readability
   - Maintain sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
   - Ensure all components adapt properly

### Requirement 5: Responsive and Accessible Navigation

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the navigation to adapt to my screen size while remaining accessible, so that I can use the application comfortably on any device.
