# Task 1 Completion: Database Schema and Core Types

## Summary
Successfully implemented the database schema and TypeScript type definitions for the practice question generator feature.

## Completed Components

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250110000001_practice_questions.sql`

Created two main tables:

#### practice_sets Table
- Stores generated practice question sets linked to wordlists
- Fields: id, wordlist_id, questions (JSONB), created_at, share_url, is_shared
- Includes validation constraints for JSONB structure
- Foreign key relationship to wordlists table with CASCADE delete

#### practice_sessions Table
- Stores individual practice session results and progress
- Fields: id, practice_set_id, session_id, start_time, end_time, timer_duration, answers (JSONB), score, completed, created_at
- Includes validation constraints for timer duration (> 0) and score (0-100)
- Foreign key relationship to practice_sets table with CASCADE delete

### 2. Performance Indexes
Created optimized indexes for common query patterns:
- `idx_practice_sets_wordlist` - Fast lookup by wordlist_id
- `idx_practice_sets_share_url` - Fast lookup for shared practice sets
- `idx_practice_sets_created_at` - Chronological ordering
- `idx_practice_sessions_set` - Fast lookup by practice_set_id
- `idx_practice_sessions_session_id` - Fast lookup by session_id (anonymous users)
- `idx_practice_sessions_created_at` - Chronological ordering
- `idx_practice_sessions_completed` - Filter by completion status

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS)
Implemented comprehensive RLS policies:

**practice_sets policies:**
- Users can view practice sets for their wordlists
- Users can create practice sets for their wordlists
- Users can update their practice sets
- Users can delete their practice sets
- Public access to shared practice sets (is_shared = true)

**practice_sessions policies:**
- Users can view their own practice sessions
- Users can create practice sessions
- Users can update their practice sessions

All policies use session_id from request headers for anonymous user tracking.

### 4. TypeScript Type Definitions
**File:** `src/types/practice.ts`

Comprehensive type definitions including:

#### Question Types
- `MatchingQuestion` - English-Mandarin pair matching
- `FillBlankQuestion` - Fill-in-the-blank with validation
- `MultipleChoiceQuestion` - Multiple choice with distractors
- Union type `Question` for all question types

#### Session Management
- `PracticeSet` - Practice question set structure
- `PracticeSession` - Session tracking and results
- `SessionState` - Reactive state for composable
- `SessionResults` - Detailed results breakdown

#### API Interfaces
- `QuestionGenerationRequest` - Request structure for question generation
- `QuestionGenerationResponse` - Response with generated questions
- `SharePracticeSetRequest/Response` - Sharing functionality
- `PracticeHistoryItem` - Session history tracking

#### Error Handling
- `QuestionGenerationError` enum - Error types
- `QuestionGenerationErrorResponse` - Error response structure

#### Local Storage
- `LocalPracticeState` - Client-side state persistence schema

### 5. Database Type Updates
**File:** `src/types/database.ts`

Added practice_sets and practice_sessions table definitions to the Database interface:
- Row, Insert, and Update types for both tables
- Helper type exports: `PracticeSet`, `PracticeSetInsert`, `PracticeSetUpdate`
- Helper type exports: `PracticeSession`, `PracticeSessionInsert`, `PracticeSessionUpdate`

## Requirements Addressed

✅ **Requirement 5.4** - Practice session results storage with score, time, question types, and timestamp
✅ **Requirement 5.7** - Practice results associated with specific wordlist and session ID
✅ **Requirement 6.6** - Store and track all generated practice URLs in database

## Technical Decisions

1. **JSONB for Questions and Answers**: Flexible schema for different question types while maintaining type safety in TypeScript
2. **Cascade Deletes**: Automatic cleanup when wordlists or practice sets are deleted
3. **Session ID Tracking**: Anonymous user support via client-generated session IDs
4. **Comprehensive Indexing**: Optimized for common query patterns (by wordlist, by session, by date)
5. **RLS Policies**: Secure data access aligned with existing anonymous architecture
6. **Decimal Score Type**: DECIMAL(5,2) allows scores from 0.00 to 100.00 with precision

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript types compile without errors
- ✅ Database schema includes all required fields
- ✅ Indexes created for performance optimization
- ✅ RLS policies implemented for security
- ✅ Foreign key relationships properly defined
- ✅ Validation constraints added for data integrity

## Next Steps

The database schema and type definitions are ready. The next task can proceed with implementing the question generation edge function using these types.
