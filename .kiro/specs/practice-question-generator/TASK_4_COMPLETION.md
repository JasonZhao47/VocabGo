- Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Disabled state when feedback is shown

**Requirements Met**: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4

---

## Component Architecture

### Shared Props Interface
All components follow a consistent prop interface:

```typescript
interface Props {
  question: QuestionType;      // Specific question type
  answer?: AnswerType;          // Optional existing answer
  showFeedback?: boolean;       // Show correct/incorrect feedback
  disabled?: boolean;           // Disable interactions
}
```

### Shared Events
All components emit:
- `answer`: Emitted when user provides/changes answer
- `submit`: (FillBlank only) Emitted on Enter key press

### Design System Compliance

**Colors**:
- Primary: Indigo (selection, focus states)
- Success: Green (correct answers)
- Error: Red (incorrect answers)
- Warning: Amber (close answers in fill-blank)
- Neutral: Gray scale for backgrounds and borders

**Interactions**:
- Smooth transitions (200ms duration)
- Hover states on interactive elements
- Focus-visible ring for keyboard navigation
- Disabled states with reduced opacity

**Accessibility**:
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Color-blind friendly (not relying solely on color)
- Screen reader compatible
- Focus management

**Responsive Design**:
- Mobile-friendly touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Flexible layouts that adapt to container width
- Readable font sizes (base: 16px, large: 18px)
- Adequate spacing for touch interactions

## File Structure

```
src/components/practice/
â”œâ”€â”€ MatchingQuestion.vue          # Matching pairs component
â”œâ”€â”€ FillBlankQuestion.vue         # Fill-in-the-blank component
â”œâ”€â”€ MultipleChoiceQuestion.vue    # Multiple choice component
â””â”€â”€ index.ts                      # Barrel export file
```

## Integration Points

### Type Definitions
All components use types from `src/types/practice.ts`:
- `MatchingQuestion`, `MatchingAnswer`
- `FillBlankQuestion`, `FillBlankAnswer`
- `MultipleChoiceQuestion`, `MultipleChoiceAnswer`

### Dependencies
- **Vue 3**: Composition API with `<script setup>`
- **GSAP**: Animation library (MatchingQuestion only)
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first styling

### Usage Example

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { MatchingQuestion, FillBlankQuestion, MultipleChoiceQuestion } from '@/components/practice';
import type { Question, Answer } from '@/types/practice';

const question = ref<Question>(...);
const answer = ref<Answer>();
const showFeedback = ref(false);

const handleAnswer = (newAnswer: Answer) => {
  answer.value = newAnswer;
};
</script>

<template>
  <MatchingQuestion
    v-if="question.type === 'matching'"
    :question="question"
    :answer="answer"
    :show-feedback="showFeedback"
    @answer="handleAnswer"
  />
  
  <FillBlankQuestion
    v-if="question.type === 'fill-blank'"
    :question="question"
    :answer="answer"
    :show-feedback="showFeedback"
    @answer="handleAnswer"
  />
  
  <MultipleChoiceQuestion
    v-if="question.type === 'multiple-choice'"
    :question="question"
    :answer="answer"
    :show-feedback="showFeedback"
    @answer="handleAnswer"
  />
</template>
```

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test matching component with 4-10 pairs
- [ ] Verify connection lines draw smoothly
- [ ] Test fill-blank with various typos
- [ ] Verify fuzzy matching accepts close answers
- [ ] Test hint system reveals first letter
- [ ] Test multiple choice with 4 options
- [ ] Verify target word highlighting works
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation on all components
- [ ] Verify dark mode styling
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (touch interactions)
- [ ] Verify screen reader compatibility

### Unit Testing (Optional - Task 4.4)
Task 4.4 is marked as optional and will not be implemented per project requirements.

## Next Steps

The question type components are now ready for integration into the practice session interface (Task 5). The next tasks will:

1. **Task 5.1**: Create PracticeSetup component for question type selection
2. **Task 5.2**: Create PracticeSession main component with timer
3. **Task 5.3**: Create ResultsView component for score display
4. **Task 5.4**: Integrate practice button into SavedWordlistsPage

## Notes

- All components are fully typed with TypeScript
- Components follow Vue 3 Composition API best practices
- Styling uses TailwindCSS utility classes
- GSAP is only used in MatchingQuestion for line animations
- All components support both light and dark modes
- Accessibility features are built-in (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Components are self-contained and reusable

## Verification

âœ… All three sub-tasks completed
âœ… No TypeScript errors in component files
âœ… Consistent prop/event interfaces
âœ… Design system compliance
âœ… Accessibility features implemented
âœ… Dark mode support
âœ… Keyboard navigation
âœ… Mobile-friendly interactions

**Status**: Task 4 is complete and ready for integration! ðŸŽ‰
