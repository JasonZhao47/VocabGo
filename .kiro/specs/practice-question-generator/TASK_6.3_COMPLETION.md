#### Progress Trend Tests (6 tests)
- Detect improving trend (>5 point increase)
- Detect declining trend (>5 point decrease)
- Detect stable trend (within 5 points)
- Return stable with less than 2 sessions
- Use last 3 sessions for trend calculation
- Require >5 point difference for trend change

#### Filtering Tests (3 tests)
- Filter sessions by date range

- Return empty array for non-existent question type

#### Actions Tests (4 tests)
- Delete a session
- Reload history after deleting session
- Clear all history
- Reload history manually

#### Format Helpers Tests (3 tests)
- Format duration (MM:SS)
- Format date (Month Day, Year)
- Format date time (Month Day, Year, Time)

#### Database Integration Tests (5 tests)
- Merge local and database history
- Prefer database data over local data for same session
- Handle database fetch errors gracefully
- Handle database fetch exceptions
- Pass wordlist ID to database fetch

#### Reactive Updates Tests (1 test)
- Update statistics when history changes

**Total: 33 tests**

## Test Coverage

### Requirements Verified

#### Requirement 5.5 (Session History Display)
✅ Display previous practice session history with dates, scores, and completion times
✅ Show session history with filtering capabilities
✅ Display progress trends showing improvement over multiple sessions

#### Requirement 5.9 (Progress Tracking)
✅ Calculate and display progress trends (improving, declining, stable)
✅ Show trend visualization with chart
✅ Track statistics across multiple sessions

### Key Features Tested

1. **Session Storage and Retrieval**
   - Local storage integration
   - Database synchronization
   - Merge strategy for local and remote data
   - Error handling for database failures

2. **Session History Display**
   - Statistics cards (total sessions, average score, best score, total time)
   - Session cards with details (wordlist name, score, duration, date)
   - Question type badges
   - Empty states

3. **Filtering Functionality**
   - Question type filtering
   - Date range filtering (today, week, month, custom)
   - Combined filters
   - Filter state management

4. **Progress Trend Calculations**
   - Trend detection algorithm (improving/declining/stable)
   - Trend visualization with SVG chart
   - Data point rendering with tooltips
   - Trend indicator with visual feedback

5. **User Actions**
   - Delete individual sessions
   - Clear all history
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - History reload after actions

6. **Score Styling**
   - Color-coded score classes based on performance
   - Visual feedback for different score ranges

## Test Results

```
✓ src/components/practice/SessionHistory.test.ts  (36 tests)
✓ src/composables/useSessionHistory.test.ts  (33 tests)

Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests  69 passed (69)
```

All 69 tests passing successfully.

## Testing Approach

### Component Tests
- Used Vue Test Utils for component mounting and interaction
- Mocked dependencies (sessionPersistence, practiceSessionService)
- Tested user interactions (clicks, form inputs, filters)
- Verified DOM rendering and updates
- Tested async data loading with proper timing

### Composable Tests
- Tested reactive state management
- Verified computed properties
- Tested action methods
- Verified format helper functions
- Tested database integration and error handling

### Mock Strategy
- Mocked localStorage operations via sessionPersistence
- Mocked API calls via practiceSessionService
- Used vi.stubGlobal for window.confirm
- Provided realistic test data matching production format

## Edge Cases Covered

1. **Empty History**: Verified empty state display
2. **Single Session**: Tested with minimal data
3. **Many Sessions**: Tested with 10+ sessions
4. **Database Errors**: Graceful degradation to local storage
5. **Network Failures**: Error handling and retry logic
6. **Filter Combinations**: Multiple filters applied simultaneously
7. **Date Boundaries**: Edge cases for date range filtering
8. **Score Ranges**: All score classification boundaries

## Performance Considerations

- Tests use appropriate timeouts for async operations (100-150ms)
- Mocked external dependencies to avoid network calls
- Efficient test data setup and teardown
- Isolated test cases to prevent interference

## Future Enhancements

Potential additional tests to consider:
1. Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
2. Performance testing (large datasets, rendering speed)
3. Mobile responsiveness testing
4. Animation testing (GSAP interactions)
5. Integration tests with real database

## Conclusion

Task 6.3 is complete with comprehensive test coverage for session history functionality. All tests pass successfully, verifying:
- Session history display and filtering
- Session storage and retrieval from both local storage and database
- Progress trend calculations and visualization
- User actions and interactions
- Error handling and edge cases

The test suite provides confidence that the session history feature works correctly and handles various scenarios gracefully.
