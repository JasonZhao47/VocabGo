# Task 6 Completion Summary: Session History and Tracking

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive session history and tracking functionality for the practice question generator, including a full-featured UI component, database storage via edge functions, and seamless integration with existing session management.

## Completed Subtasks

### 6.1 Create SessionHistory Component ✅
Created a comprehensive session history display interface with:

**Features Implemented:**
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Displays total sessions, average score, best score, and total practice time
- **Progress Trend Indicator**: Visual indicator showing if user is improving, declining, or stable
- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Filter by question type (matching, fill-blank, multiple-choice)
  - Filter by date range (today, last 7 days, last 30 days, all time, custom range)
  - Custom date range picker for precise filtering
- **Interactive Trend Chart**: SVG-based line chart showing score progression over last 10 sessions
- **Session Cards**: Detailed view of each practice session with:
  - Wordlist name
  - Score with color-coded indicators (excellent, good, fair, needs improvement)
  - Duration
  - Completion date/time
  - Question types practiced
  - Delete action
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no history exists or filters return no results
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layout with proper breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/practice/SessionHistory.vue` - Main component (600+ lines)
- Updated `src/components/practice/index.ts` - Added export

**Requirements Addressed:**
- ✅ 5.5: Display previous practice session history with dates, scores, and completion times
- ✅ 5.9: Display trends showing improvement over multiple sessions

### 6.2 Create Session Storage Edge Functions ✅
Implemented three Supabase edge functions for session management:

**Edge Functions Created:**

1. **save-practice-session** (`supabase/functions/save-practice-session/index.ts`)
   - Saves completed practice sessions to database
   - Validates session ownership and practice set access
   - Enforces score range validation (0-100)
   - Includes comprehensive error handling
   - Full CORS support

2. **fetch-practice-history** (`supabase/functions/fetch-practice-history/index.ts`)
   - Retrieves practice session history for users
   - Supports filtering by wordlist ID
   - Implements pagination (limit/offset)
   - Joins with practice_sets and wordlists tables
   - Extracts question types from practice set data
   - Returns formatted history items

3. **cleanup-practice-sessions** (`supabase/functions/cleanup-practice-sessions/index.ts`)
   - Automated cleanup of old/incomplete sessions
   - Removes incomplete sessions older than 24 hours
   - Removes completed sessions older than 90 days
   - Removes orphaned practice sets (no associated sessions)
   - Removes unshared practice sets older than 30 days
   - Returns cleanup statistics

**Test Files Created:**
- `supabase/functions/save-practice-session/index.test.ts`
- `supabase/functions/fetch-practice-history/index.test.ts`
- `supabase/functions/cleanup-practice-sessions/index.test.ts`

**Service Layer Created:**
- `src/services/practiceSessionService.ts` - Client-side API wrapper
  - `savePracticeSession()` - Save session to database
  - `fetchPracticeHistory()` - Fetch history with filters
  - `cleanupPracticeSessions()` - Trigger cleanup
- `src/services/practiceSessionService.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests

**Integration Updates:**
- Updated `src/composables/useSessionHistory.ts`:
  - Integrated database fetching with local storage
  - Merges local and database histories
  - Handles errors gracefully with fallback to local data
  - Added error state tracking
  
- Updated `src/composables/usePracticeSession.ts`:
  - Automatically saves completed sessions to database
  - Maintains local storage as backup
  - Continues on database save failure (resilient)

**Requirements Addressed:**
- ✅ 5.4: Save session results including score, time taken, question types, and timestamp
- ✅ 5.7: Associate results with specific wordlist and session ID

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Leverages existing `practice_sessions` table from migration
- Uses session-based RLS policies for security
- Implements proper foreign key relationships
- Includes performance indexes for queries

### Data Flow
1. **Session Completion**:
   - User completes practice session
   - Results calculated locally
   - Saved to local storage (immediate)
   - Saved to database (async, non-blocking)
   
2. **History Loading**:
   - Load from local storage first (fast)
   - Fetch from database (complete data)
   - Merge both sources (deduplicate)
   - Display unified history

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Runs periodically via cron job
   - Removes stale data automatically
   - Maintains database performance

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if database unavailable
- Local storage serves as reliable backup
- User experience unaffected by network issues
- Comprehensive error logging

### Performance Optimizations
- Local storage for instant feedback
- Database for persistence and cross-device sync
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Pagination support for large histories
- SVG charts for smooth rendering

## Testing Coverage

### Edge Function Tests
- ✅ Authentication validation
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ CORS headers
- ✅ Success scenarios

### Service Tests
- ✅ API call formatting
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Network failure handling
- ✅ Response parsing
- ✅ Session ID injection

### Component Features
- Visual trend indicators
- Interactive charts
- Filtering and sorting
- Responsive layout
- Accessibility features

10. `.kiro/specs/practice-question-generator/TASK_6_COMPLETION.md`

### Modified Files (3)

2. `src/composables/useSessionHistory.ts` - Added database integration
3. `src/composables/usePracticeSession.ts` - Added database save on completion

## Usage Example

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Display session history for a specific wordlist -->
    <SessionHistory :wordlist-id="wordlistId" />
    
    <!-- Or display all session history -->
    <SessionHistory />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { SessionHistory } from '@/components/practice';

const wordlistId = 'some-wordlist-id';
</script>
```

## Next Steps

The session history and tracking system is now complete. Users can:
- View comprehensive practice history
- Track progress over time with visual trends
- Filter sessions by type and date
- See detailed statistics and scores
- Have data persisted across sessions and devices

To use this feature:
1. Deploy the edge functions to Supabase
2. Integrate SessionHistory component into wordlist pages
3. Set up cron job for cleanup function (optional)
4. Monitor database usage and adjust retention policies as needed

## Requirements Verification

✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Session results are saved with all required data
✅ **Requirement 5.5**: Previous practice sessions displayed with dates, scores, and times
✅ **Requirement 5.7**: Results associated with wordlist and session ID
✅ **Requirement 5.9**: Trends showing improvement displayed visually

All requirements for session history and tracking have been successfully implemented and tested.
