# Task 9.1 Completion: Integrate All Components into Main Application

## Overview
Successfully integrated the practice question system into the main VocabGo application with proper routing, navigation, and consistent styling following the ElevenLabs design system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Practice Page (`src/pages/PracticePage.vue`)
- **Purpose**: Main page for the practice flow that orchestrates the entire practice session
- **Features**:
  - Loading state with spinner and progress messages
  - Error state with ErrorDisplay component and retry functionality
  - Active practice session with PracticeSession component
  - Completed state with ResultsView component
  - Share modal integration
  - Header navigation with back button (hidden during active session)
  
- **State Management**:
  - Uses `usePracticeSession` composable for session state
  - Manages practice flow states: loading, active, completed, error
  - Handles question generation via `generatePracticeQuestions` service
  - Integrates with router for navigation and query parameters

- **Query Parameters**:
  - `wordlistId`: ID of the wordlist to practice
  - `wordlistName`: Display name of the wordlist
  - `questionTypes`: Comma-separated list of question types
  - `timerDuration`: Optional timer duration in minutes

### 2. Updated Router Configuration (`src/router/index.ts`)
- Added `/practice` route with lazy-loaded PracticePage component
- Maintains consistent lazy-loading pattern with other routes
- Positioned logically between wordlists and toast-demo routes

### 3. Enhanced SavedWordlistsPage Integration
- **Practice Button**: Added to each wordlist card with proper validation
  - Disabled for wordlists with < 4 words
  - Shows tooltip explaining minimum requirements
  - Styled consistently with ElevenLabs design system
  
- **Practice Setup Modal**: Integrated PracticeSetup component
  - Opens when user clicks "Practice Questions" button
  - Allows selection of question types and timer configuration
  - Shows estimated completion time
  
- **Navigation Flow**:
  - On question generation, navigates to `/practice` with query params
  - Passes wordlist ID, name, question types, and timer duration
  - Closes modal before navigation for smooth UX

### 4. Design System Consistency

#### Color Palette
- Primary: `#000000` (Black) for primary actions
- Secondary: `#ffffff` (White) with borders for secondary actions
- Background: `#f9fafb` (Light gray) for page backgrounds
- Borders: `#e5e7eb` (Gray-200) for subtle borders
- Text: `#000000` (Black) for headings, `#6b7280` (Gray-500) for body text

#### Typography
- Headings: 18-24px, font-weight 600-700
- Body: 14-16px, font-weight 400-500
- Consistent line-height: 1.5-1.6 for readability

#### Spacing
- Base unit: 8px
- Consistent padding: 16px, 24px, 32px
- Gap spacing: 12px, 16px, 24px

#### Border Radius
- Small: 8px for buttons and inputs
- Medium: 12px for cards and modals
- Large: 16px for major containers

#### Animations
- Duration: 150-250ms for interactions
- Easing: ease-out for natural feel
- Transitions on hover, focus, and state changes

### 5. Navigation & Routing

#### Entry Points
1. **From SavedWordlistsPage**: Click "Practice Questions" button → Setup modal → Navigate to practice
2. **Direct URL**: `/practice?wordlistId=...&wordlistName=...&questionTypes=...&timerDuration=...`

#### Exit Points
1. **Back Button**: Returns to `/wordlists` page
2. **Results View**: Options to retry, generate new questions, or go back
3. **Error State**: Retry or back to wordlists

#### Navigation Flow
```
SavedWordlistsPage
    ↓ (Click Practice Button)
PracticeSetup Modal
    ↓ (Generate Questions)
PracticePage (Loading)
    ↓ (Questions Generated)
PracticePage (Active Session)
    ↓ (Submit/Timer Expires)
PracticePage (Results)
    ↓ (Back/Retry/New)
SavedWordlistsPage or PracticePage
```

### 6. Error Handling & User Feedback

#### Error States
- **No Wordlist Selected**: Shows error with back button
- **Question Generation Failed**: Shows ErrorDisplay with retry option
- **Network Errors**: Handled by practiceErrorHandler with user-friendly messages
- **Validation Errors**: Inline validation in setup modal

#### Loading States
- **Generating Questions**: Spinner with progress messages
- **Cached Questions**: Info toast notification
- **Retry Attempts**: Progress messages during retries

#### Success States
- **Questions Generated**: Smooth transition to practice session
- **Session Completed**: Animated results view with score breakdown
- **Session Saved**: Toast notification confirming save

### 7. Accessibility Features

#### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus states clearly visible
- Tab order follows logical flow

#### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for icon buttons
- Status announcements for state changes

#### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast text and backgrounds (WCAG AA compliant)
- Color-blind friendly indicators (not relying solely on color)
- Clear visual hierarchy with size and weight

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness

#### Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

#### Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px height)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Collapsible navigation elements
- Optimized font sizes for readability
- Swipe gestures for question navigation (in PracticeSession)

#### Responsive Adjustments
- Header: Hides button text on mobile, shows only icon
- Error container: Full-width buttons on mobile
- Practice session: Optimized layout for small screens
