# Task 6 Completion: Implement Progress Tracking

## Overview
Successfully implemented chunk-level progress tracking for the chunk-based wordlist generation feature. The system now tracks and displays progress for each chunk during processing, showing which chunks succeeded or failed.

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes (Edge Function)

#### 1. Enhanced Response Type (`supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`)
- Added `ChunkProgress` interface to track individual chunk status:
  ```typescript
  interface ChunkProgress {
    chunkId: string
    position: number
    totalChunks: number
    status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
    wordsExtracted?: number
    error?: string
  }
  ```
- Extended `ProcessResponse` metadata to include `chunkProgress` array
- Added `MAX_CONCURRENT_CHUNKS` constant (3 chunks processed in parallel)

#### 2. Progress Tracking During Processing
- Track progress for each chunk as it completes
- Record successful chunks with word count
- Record failed chunks with error messages
- Include chunk progress in API response metadata

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. State Management (`src/state/uploadState.ts`)
- Added `ChunkProgress` interface matching backend
- Extended `UploadState` with:
  - `chunkProgress: ChunkProgress[]` - Array of chunk progress data
  - `isChunked: boolean` - Flag indicating if document was chunked
- Added `setChunkProgress()` function to update chunk progress
- Reset chunk progress on new upload
- Preserve chunk progress after completion for display

#### 2. Upload Service (`src/services/uploadService.ts`)
- Extended `ProcessResult` to include:
  - `chunkProgress?: ChunkProgress[]`
  - `warnings?: string[]`
- Updated both processing paths (client-side and server-side extraction) to capture chunk progress from API response

#### 3. Upload Composable (`src/composables/useUpload.ts`)
- Import and use `setChunkProgress` function
- Update chunk progress when available in API response
- Maintain existing stage-based progress for non-chunked documents

#### 4. Processing Modal UI (`src/components/processing/ProcessingModal.vue`)

**Visual Display:**
- Added chunk progress section that displays when `isChunked` is true
- Shows "Processing chunk X of Y" message
- Grid of chunk status indicators:
  - ✓ Green checkmark for completed chunks
  - ✗ Red X for failed chunks
  - Spinner for processing chunks
- Summary text showing successful vs failed chunks

**Progress Calculation:**
- Enhanced `progressPercentage` computed property:
  - For chunked documents: Calculate based on completed/total chunks
  - For non-chunked: Use existing stage-based progress
- Added computed properties:
  - `totalChunks` - Total number of chunks
  - `completedChunks` - Number of completed or failed chunks
  - `successfulChunks` - Number of successfully completed chunks
  - `failedChunks` - Number of failed chunks

**Responsive Design:**
- Chunk indicators scale appropriately on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly sizing maintained
- Grid layout adapts to available space

### Testing

#### 1. Backend Tests (`supabase/functions/process-document/index.test.ts`)
Added two new tests:
- **Successful chunk processing**: Verifies chunk progress structure with all chunks completed
- **Partial failure handling**: Verifies chunk progress with mixed success/failure states

#### 2. Frontend Tests (`src/state/uploadState.test.ts`)
Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Initial state (empty chunk progress)
- Setting chunk progress correctly
- Tracking failed chunks with error messages
- Resetting chunk progress on new upload
- Preserving chunk progress after completion
- Clearing chunk progress on reset

## Requirements Coverage

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: Update processing state to track chunk-level progress
- Added `chunkProgress` array to state
- Track status for each chunk (processing/completed/failed)

✅ **Requirement 6.2**: Emit progress events for each chunk completion
- Backend tracks and returns progress for each chunk
- Frontend updates state with chunk progress from API response

✅ **Requirement 6.3**: Display "Processing chunk X of Y" messages
- Modal shows "Processing chunk X of Y" label
- Updates dynamically as chunks complete

✅ **Requirement 6.4**: Show which chunks succeeded/failed
- Visual indicators for each chunk status
- Summary text showing count of successful vs failed chunks
- Color-coded status (green for success, red for failure)

✅ **Requirement 6.5**: Add progress percentage calculation
- Progress bar calculates percentage based on completed chunks
- Falls back to stage-based progress for non-chunked documents

## User Experience

### For Small Documents (< 8,000 characters)
- No change in behavior
- Shows traditional stage-based progress (Cleaning → Extracting → Translating)

### For Large Documents (> 8,000 characters)
- Displays chunk progress section
- Shows real-time status of each chunk
- Visual grid of chunk indicators
- Clear summary of success/failure counts
- Progress bar reflects chunk completion percentage

### Error Handling
- Failed chunks shown with red X indicator
- Error messages captured in chunk progress
- Partial success supported (some chunks fail, others succeed)
- User sees which specific chunks failed

## Technical Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Chunk progress is optional in API response
- Frontend gracefully handles responses without chunk progress
- Non-chunked documents continue to work as before

### Performance
- Chunk progress adds minimal overhead
- Progress tracking happens during existing processing
- No additional API calls required

### Accessibility
- Chunk status indicators include aria-labels
- Screen reader announcements for progress updates
- Keyboard navigation maintained

## Next Steps

The progress tracking implementation is complete and ready for:
1. Integration testing with real large documents
2. User acceptance testing
3. Deployment to staging environment
