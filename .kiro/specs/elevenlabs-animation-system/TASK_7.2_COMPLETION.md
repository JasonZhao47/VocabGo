# Task 7.2 Completion: Update Modal Component with Animations

## Task Overview
Update Modal component with animations by integrating useModalAnimation composable, adding stagger animation for modal content, testing open/close transitions, and verifying backdrop click handling.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ 1. Integrated useModalAnimation Composable
The Modal component (`src/components/ui/Modal.vue`) successfully integrates the `useModalAnimation` composable:

```typescript
// Initialize modal animation composable
const modalAnimation = useModalAnimation({ duration: 300, backdropBlur: true })
const { shouldAnimate, getDuration } = useMotionPreference()
```

The composable is used in the transition handlers:
- `onEnter()`: Calls `modalAnimation.open(modalContentRef.value, backdropRef.value)`
- `close()`: Calls `modalAnimation.close(modalContentRef.value, backdropRef.value, callback)`

### ✅ 2. Added Stagger Animation for Modal Content
Implemented `animateModalContent()` function that staggers child elements with `data-animate-child` attribute:

```typescript
const animateModalContent = () => {
  if (!shouldAnimate.value || !modalContentRef.value) return
  
  const children = modalContentRef.value.querySelectorAll('[data-animate-child]')
  if (children.length === 0) return
  
  gsap.from(children, {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 10,
    duration: getDuration(animationConfig.duration.normal) / 1000,
    stagger: animationConfig.stagger.fast / 1000,
    ease: animationConfig.easing.easeOut,
  })
}
```

Modal sections (header, content, footer) are marked with `data-animate-child` for stagger effect.

### ✅ 3. Open/Close Transitions Verified
The modal implements smooth open/close transitions:

**Open Animation:**
- Backdrop fades in (duration * 0.7)
- Modal scales from 0.95 to 1.0 with slide-up from y: 20
- Uses spring easing for natural feel
- Child elements stagger in after modal appears

**Close Animation:**
- Modal scales down to 0.95 and slides down to y: 20
- Backdrop fades out (duration * 0.7)
- Uses easeIn for smooth exit
- Callback triggers after animation completes

**Animation Interruption Handling:**
- `useModalAnimation` composable kills any existing animations before starting new ones
- Prevents animation conflicts when rapidly opening/closing

### ✅ 4. Backdrop Click Handling Verified
The modal implements comprehensive backdrop interaction:

```typescript
const handleBackdropClick = () => {
  if (props.closeOnBackdrop) {
    close()
  }
}
```

Features:
- `closeOnBackdrop` prop (default: true) controls behavior
- Backdrop element has `@click="handleBackdropClick"`
- Modal content has `@click.stop` to prevent event bubbling
- Backdrop has `backdrop-blur-sm` class for visual effect

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 5.1: Modal Open Animation ✅
- Backdrop fades in over 210ms (300ms * 0.7)
- Modal scales from 0.95 to 1.0 over 300ms
- Implementation matches specification

### Requirement 5.2: Modal Close Animation ✅
- Modal scales down to 0.95 over 240ms (300ms * 0.8)
- Fade out animation applied
- Implementation matches specification

### Requirement 5.3: Backdrop Blur Effect ✅
- Backdrop has `backdrop-blur-sm` class
- Blur effect applied via Tailwind CSS
- Transitions smoothly with backdrop opacity

### Requirement 5.4: Stagger Child Animations ✅
- Child elements with `data-animate-child` attribute stagger in
- Uses `animationConfig.stagger.fast` (50ms) delay
- Fade and slide-up effect applied

### Requirement 5.5: Backdrop Click Handling ✅
- Clicking backdrop triggers close animation
- Controlled by `closeOnBackdrop` prop
- Modal content click doesn't trigger close (event.stopPropagation)

## Additional Features Implemented

### Accessibility
- Focus trap implementation with keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes (role, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, aria-modal)
- Escape key handling with `closeOnEscape` prop
- Focus restoration to previous element on close
- Unique IDs generated for accessibility labels

### Props and Configuration
- `size`: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'full'
- `closable`: Show/hide close button
- `closeOnBackdrop`: Control backdrop click behavior
- `closeOnEscape`: Control escape key behavior
- `persistent`: Prevent closing (for critical dialogs)

### Lifecycle Events
- `before-open`, `open`, `after-open`
- `before-close`, `close`, `after-close`
- Allows parent components to react to modal state changes

### Body Scroll Lock
- Prevents background scrolling when modal is open
- Automatically restored on close
- Cleanup on component unmount

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`src/components/ui/Modal.test.ts`) covering:
- Rendering with different props
- Open/close behavior
- Backdrop click handling
- Persistent modal behavior
- Size variations
- Slot rendering (header, default, footer)
- Accessibility attributes
- Lifecycle events
- Animation element attributes

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/components/ui/Modal.vue` - Already fully implemented with all required features

## Files Created
- ✅ `src/components/ui/Modal.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite for modal component

## Conclusion
Task 7.2 is **COMPLETE**. The Modal component successfully integrates the useModalAnimation composable with all required features:
- Smooth open/close animations with backdrop fade and modal scale
- Stagger animations for child content
- Backdrop blur effect
- Comprehensive backdrop click handling
- Animation interruption handling
- Full accessibility support
- Extensive test coverage

The implementation meets all requirements (5.1-5.5) from the design specification and provides a polished, accessible modal experience consistent with the ElevenLabs-inspired animation system.
