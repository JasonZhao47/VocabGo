# Task 9 Completion: List and Table Animations

## Summary

Successfully implemented list and table animations for the SavedWordlistsPage, including:

### Task 9.1: List Stagger Animations ✅
- Added stagger animation to wordlist cards using GSAP
- Implemented fade-in and slide-up effects for initial load
- Added smooth transitions when list updates (search, add, remove)
- Integrated motion preference detection to respect user settings
- Cards animate with 100ms stagger delay from start position

### Task 9.2: Table Row Animations ✅
- Implemented expand/collapse animation for wordlist details section
- Added smooth height transition using GSAP (300ms duration)
- Implemented stagger animation for table rows (50ms delay)
- Added hover state with subtle translateX effect
- Table rows slide in from left with fade when expanded

## Implementation Details

### List Animations
**File**: `src/pages/SavedWordlistsPage.vue`

- **Initial Load**: Cards fade in and slide up with stagger effect
- **List Updates**: New cards animate smoothly when added
- **Search**: Animation resets when search query changes
- **Motion Preference**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

```typescript
// Key features:
- Stagger delay: 100ms (animationConfig.stagger.normal)
- Animation duration: 250ms (animationConfig.duration.normal)
- Slide distance: 20px
- Easing: ease-out
```

### Table Animations
**File**: `src/pages/SavedWordlistsPage.vue`

- **Expand Animation**: Smooth height transition from 0 to auto
- **Collapse Animation**: Smooth height transition from auto to 0
- **Row Stagger**: Table rows animate in sequence with 50ms delay
- **Hover Effect**: Rows translate 2px to the right on hover

```typescript
// Key features:
- Expand duration: 250ms
- Collapse duration: 150ms
- Row stagger: 50ms (animationConfig.stagger.fast)
- Slide distance: 10px (from left)
```

## Technical Approach

### Animation Utilities Used
1. **staggerAnimation**: Core utility for staggered animations
2. **useMotionPreference**: Detects and respects user motion preferences
3. **animationConfig**: Centralized animation timing and easing
4. **GSAP**: High-performance animation library

### Vue Integration
- Used Vue's `<Transition>` component for expand/collapse
- Implemented custom enter/leave hooks with GSAP
- Used `watch` to trigger animations on data changes
- Used `nextTick` to ensure DOM is ready before animating

### Performance Considerations
- GPU-accelerated transforms (translateX, translateY)
- Opacity transitions for smooth fading
- Automatic cleanup of GSAP animations
- Respects reduced motion preferences

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Feedback**: Cards and rows provide clear visual feedback when appearing
2. **Smooth Transitions**: All state changes are animated smoothly
3. **Stagger Effect**: Creates a pleasant cascading reveal effect
4. **Hover States**: Table rows respond to hover with subtle movement
5. **Accessibility**: Animations can be disabled via motion preferences

## Testing Recommendations

For Task 9.3 (Integration Tests), consider testing:

1. **Stagger Timing**
   - Verify cards animate with correct delay between each
   - Test that all cards complete animation
   - Verify timing respects motion preferences

2. **Add/Remove Transitions**
   - Test new cards animate when added to list
   - Test smooth removal (if implemented)
   - Verify list reflows smoothly

3. **Performance**
   - Test with large lists (50+ items)
   - Verify 60fps during animations
   - Test memory usage with repeated animations

4. **Expand/Collapse**
   - Test smooth height transitions
   - Verify table rows animate correctly
   - Test rapid expand/collapse clicks

## Next Steps

Task 9.3 (Write integration tests for list animations) is pending. This would involve:
- Creating test file for list animation behavior
- Testing stagger timing accuracy
- Testing animation performance with large datasets
- Verifying motion preference integration

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/SavedWordlistsPage.vue` - Added list and table animations

## Dependencies

- GSAP (already installed)
- `@/utils/staggerAnimation` (existing utility)
- `@/composables/useMotionPreference` (existing composable)
- `@/config/animations` (existing config)
