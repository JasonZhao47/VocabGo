# ElevenLabs-Inspired Animation System

## Overview

This spec defines a comprehensive animation system for VocabGo, inspired by the smooth, polished animations observed in ElevenLabs.io. The system provides consistent, performant, and accessible animations throughout the application.

## Key Features

- **Smooth Page Transitions**: Fade and slide effects with stagger support
- **Interactive Feedback**: Hover, active, and focus state animations
- **Modal Animations**: Scale and backdrop blur effects
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens with shimmer effects
- **List Animations**: Stagger effects for cards and tables
- **Accessibility**: Full support for reduced motion preferences
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated animations maintaining 60fps

## Quick Start

To begin implementing this spec:

1. **Review the Requirements** (requirements.md)
   - Understand all 14 requirement categories
   - Note the acceptance criteria for each feature

2. **Study the Design** (design.md)
   - Review the architecture and component structure
   - Understand the composable-based approach
   - Familiarize yourself with GSAP integration

3. **Start with Tasks** (tasks.md)
   - Begin with Task 1: Set up foundation and dependencies
   - Follow the sequential order for best results
   - Optional test tasks are marked with * for MVP speed

## Technology Stack

- **GSAP 3.12+**: Primary animation library
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Reusable animation composables
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes for simple transitions
- **@vueuse/core**: Additional Vue utilities

## Architecture Highlights

### Composables
- `useMotionPreference()`: Detect and respect user motion preferences
- `usePageTransition()`: Handle route transition animations
- `useInteractiveAnimation()`: Manage hover and click feedback
- `useModalAnimation()`: Control modal open/close animations
- `useLoadingAnimation()`: Manage loading states

### Configuration
- Centralized animation config with durations, easing, and scales
- Consistent timing across all animations
- Easy to customize and maintain

### Performance
- GPU-accelerated transforms and opacity
- Automatic complexity reduction on low-end devices
- Respect for prefers-reduced-motion

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Tasks 1-3)
   - Set up GSAP and configuration
   - Implement motion preference detection
   - Create core utilities

2. **Phase 2: Core Animations** (Tasks 4-7)
   - Page transitions
   - Button and card animations
   - Form input animations
   - Modal animations

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Tasks 8-12)
   - Loading states
   - List animations
   - Toast notifications
   - Micro-interactions

4. **Phase 4: Polish** (Tasks 13-16)
   - Performance optimization
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Documentation
   - Cross-browser testing

## Key Design Decisions

### Why GSAP?
- Industry-leading performance
- Advanced features (timeline, easing, plugins)
- Excellent browser compatibility
- Great developer experience

### Why Composables?
- Reusable across components
- Easy to test in isolation
- Follows Vue 3 best practices
- Composable behavior patterns

### Hybrid Approach
- **CSS**: Simple transitions (color, opacity)
- **JavaScript**: Complex sequences, timelines, stagger effects

## Accessibility

The system fully supports accessibility requirements:
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Provides alternative feedback when animations are disabled
- Maintains keyboard navigation during transitions
- Ensures screen reader compatibility

## Performance Targets

- Page transitions: < 300ms
- Interactive feedback: < 150ms
- Modal animations: < 400ms
- Maintain 60fps during all animations
- No layout thrashing or reflows

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge: 90+
- Firefox: 88+
- Safari: 14+
- Mobile Safari: 14+
- Chrome Android: 90+

## Getting Started with Implementation

To start implementing tasks:

1. Open `tasks.md` in Kiro
2. Click "Start task" next to Task 1
3. Follow the implementation details in each task
4. Reference the design document for code examples
5. Test thoroughly before moving to the next task

- [GSAP Documentation](https://greensock.com/docs/)
- [Vue 3 Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html)
- [Web Animations Best Practices](https://web.dev/animations/)
- [Reduced Motion Guide](https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/)

## Notes

- All animations respect user motion preferences
- Performance is monitored and optimized automatically
- The system is designed to be maintainable and extensible
- Documentation will be created as part of the implementation

## Next Steps

1. Review all three spec documents (requirements, design, tasks)
2. Set up your development environment
3. Start with Task 1: Foundation setup
4. Implement tasks sequentially for best results
5. Test each feature thoroughly before proceeding
