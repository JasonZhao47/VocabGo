# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an ElevenLabs-inspired animation system in VocabGo. The goal is to create smooth, polished micro-interactions and transitions that enhance the user experience through purposeful animations, similar to the fluid interface patterns observed in ElevenLabs.io.

Key observations from ElevenLabs:
- Smooth page transitions with fade and slide effects
- Subtle hover states with scale and color transitions
- Gradient-based visual elements with smooth color transitions
- Card-based layouts with elevation changes on interaction
- Skeleton loading states with shimmer effects
- Modal/dialog animations with backdrop blur
- Button interactions with ripple-like feedback
- Sidebar navigation with smooth expand/collapse
- Tab switching with slide transitions
- Form input focus states with border animations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Animation Foundation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to feel responsive and polished with smooth animations, so that interactions feel natural and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize a centralized animation configuration with consistent timing functions and durations
2. WHEN any UI element transitions THEN the system SHALL use easing functions (ease-in-out, cubic-bezier) for natural motion
3. WHEN animations are triggered THEN the system SHALL respect user's prefers-reduced-motion settings
4. WHEN multiple animations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance without jank
5. IF a user has motion sensitivity enabled THEN the system SHALL disable or reduce animation intensity

### Requirement 2: Page Transitions

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions between pages, so that navigation feels seamless and I maintain context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL apply a fade-in transition (300ms duration)
2. WHEN entering a new page THEN the system SHALL apply a subtle slide-up effect (20-30px) combined with fade
3. WHEN leaving a page THEN the system SHALL apply a fade-out transition (200ms duration)
4. WHEN page content loads THEN the system SHALL stagger child element animations for a cascading effect
5. IF navigation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL smoothly reverse the transition

### Requirement 3: Interactive Element Animations

**User Story:** As a user, I want buttons and interactive elements to provide visual feedback, so that I know my actions are registered.

3. WHEN a modal backdrop is present THEN the system SHALL apply a blur effect (backdrop-filter) with 200ms transition
4. WHEN a modal contains content THEN the system SHALL stagger child element animations (50ms delay)
5. IF a user clicks outside the modal THEN the system SHALL trigger the close animation

### Requirement 6: Loading States and Skeletons

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see smooth loading indicators, so that I understand content is being fetched and the wait feels shorter.

3. WHEN content loads THEN the system SHALL fade out skeletons and fade in real content (300ms)
4. WHEN a button is in loading state THEN the system SHALL show a spinner with smooth rotation (1s linear infinite)
5. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL animate progress bars smoothly with width transitions

### Requirement 7: Form Input Animations

**User Story:** As a user, I want form inputs to feel responsive and provide clear feedback, so that I know which field I'm interacting with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN focusing an input THEN the system SHALL animate border color change (200ms) and add subtle shadow
2. WHEN typing in an input THEN the system SHALL maintain the focus state animation
3. WHEN an input has an error THEN the system SHALL shake the input (300ms) and change border to error color
4. WHEN an input is validated successfully THEN the system SHALL briefly show a success indicator with fade animation
5. WHEN a label floats THEN the system SHALL animate the label position and scale (200ms)

### Requirement 8: List and Table Animations
