# VocabGo Project Retrospective

**Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Scope:** PRD, Requirements, Design, Tasks, and Implementation Review

---

## Executive Summary

The VocabGo project successfully delivered an MVP for AI-powered bilingual wordlist extraction. The spec-driven development approach proved effective, with clear documentation enabling rapid implementation. However, several gaps between planning and execution emerged, particularly around architecture decisions and feature scope management.

**Key Metrics:**
- MVP Completion: ~85% (13/14 tasks complete)
- Documentation Quality: Excellent (comprehensive guides created)
- Architecture Alignment: Good (major decision documented)
- Spec-to-Implementation Gap: Moderate (some deviations from original plan)

---

## What Went Well âœ…

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Process

**Strength:** The structured approach (PRD â†’ Requirements â†’ Design â†’ Tasks) provided clear direction.

- PRD (2025-10-08.md) established clear business context and user stories
- Requirements.md translated PRD into 10 detailed EARS-format requirements
- Design.md provided comprehensive technical architecture
- Tasks.md broke down implementation into 20 actionable tasks

**Evidence:**
- All major features from PRD were captured in requirements
- Design document addressed all 10 requirements
- Task completion tracking shows clear progress (Tasks 1-4 complete, 5-14 in progress)

**Impact:** Team had clear roadmap, reducing ambiguity and enabling parallel work.

### 2. Pragmatic Architecture Decision

**Strength:** The decision to use traditional text cleaning instead of LLM-based cleaning was well-documented and justified.

**Key Document:** ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md

**Rationale:**
- Cost efficiency: 30-40% reduction in LLM token budget
- Performance: <100ms vs 1-3 seconds
- Predictability: Deterministic output
- Simplicity: No prompt engineering required

**Impact:** This decision likely saved significant development time and operational costs while maintaining quality.

### 3. MVP Scope Management

**Strength:** Creation of tasks-mvp.md showed good product judgment.

**Simplifications:**
- Removed queue management (Task 5)
- Removed rate limiting (Task 6)
- Removed storage cleanup automation (Task 15)
- Removed comprehensive monitoring (Task 17)
- Removed performance optimization (Task 19)

**Impact:** Enabled faster time-to-market while preserving core value proposition.

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

**Strength:** Excellent supporting documentation created.

**Documents Created:**
- ENV_SETUP.md - Environment configuration guide
- QUICKSTART.md - 5-minute setup guide
- TESTING_CHECKLIST.md - Manual testing procedures
- TASK_14_COMPLETION.md - Detailed completion report
- supabase/TASK-1-COMPLETION.md - Infrastructure verification

**Impact:** Reduced onboarding friction and enabled independent testing.

### 5. Test Coverage Strategy

**Strength:** Balanced automated and manual testing approach.

**Automated:**
- E2E test suite (tests/e2e/end-to-end.test.ts)
- Unit tests for parsers, LLM service, agents

**Manual:**
- 9 detailed test cases in TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
- Performance benchmarks
- Word quality validation criteria

**Impact:** Comprehensive coverage without over-engineering.

## What Could Be Improved ðŸ”§

### 1. PRD-to-Requirements Alignment Issues

**Issue:** Some PRD features were lost or transformed in translation to requirements.

**Examples:**

PRD Section 6 (Non-Functional Requirements):
- "System handles up to 5 concurrent uploads globally"
- "Auto-retry LLM tasks on timeout/failure up to 3 times"

Requirements Document:
- Requirement 6.4: "WHEN the system detects rapid successive uploads..."
- Requirement 6.2: "WHEN an LLM agent call times out..."

**Gap:** The PRD's global concurrency limit (5 uploads) became a rate-limiting requirement, but the implementation mechanism wasn't clearly specified until the design phase.

**Impact:** Created ambiguity about whether this was a hard limit, queue-based, or user-based restriction.

**Recommendation:**
- Add explicit traceability matrix: PRD Section â†’ Requirement ID
- Flag when PRD features are intentionally deferred or modified
- Include "Out of Scope" section in requirements to document deferred features

### 2. Design-to-Implementation Drift

**Issue:** The original design assumed a queue-based architecture, but MVP implementation went synchronous.

**Original Design (design.md):**
Queue Management â†’ Cleaner â†’ Extractor â†’ Translator

**MVP Implementation (tasks-mvp.md):**
Direct API call â†’ Cleaner â†’ Extractor â†’ Translator (synchronous)

**Gap:** The design document wasn't updated to reflect the MVP simplification, creating confusion about the "source of truth."

**Impact:** 
- Design document describes infrastructure (queue tables, job tracking) that isn't used in MVP
- Future developers might implement the wrong architecture

**Recommendation:**
- Create design-mvp.md or add "MVP Simplifications" section to design.md
- Update architecture diagrams to show both "Full" and "MVP" paths
- Add comments in code referencing design decisions

### 3. Requirements Granularity Inconsistency

**Issue:** Some requirements are very specific, others are vague.

**Too Specific:**
- Requirement 6.1: "WHEN a 30-page PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 30 seconds"

**Too Vague:**
- Requirement 2.3: "WHEN the cleaning service completes processing THEN it SHALL filter out at least 90% of unrelated content"

**Gap:** The 90% metric has no clear measurement methodology. How is "unrelated content" quantified?

**Impact:** Difficult to verify requirement satisfaction objectively.

**Recommendation:**
- Define measurement criteria for percentage-based requirements
- Use ranges for performance requirements (e.g., "20-30 seconds for 30-page PDF")
- Add "Verification Method" column to requirements

### 4. Missing Error Handling Specifications

**Issue:** Error scenarios are mentioned but not comprehensively specified.

**PRD mentions:**
- "Auto-retry LLM tasks on timeout/failure up to 3 times"

**Requirements cover:**
- Requirement 6.2: Retry logic
- Requirement 6.3: Error notification

**Design specifies:**
- Error codes enum
- Retry configuration

**Gap:** No requirements for:
- What happens after 3 failed retries?
- Should partial results be saved?
- How are users notified of different error types?
- What's the recovery path for each error scenario?

**Impact:** Implementation had to make ad-hoc decisions about error handling.

**Recommendation:**
- Add dedicated "Error Handling" requirement section
- Create error scenario matrix: Error Type â†’ User Impact â†’ System Response â†’ Recovery Path
- Include error handling in acceptance criteria

### 5. Test Data Management

**Issue:** No standardized test data or fixtures defined in specs.

**Current State:**
- TESTING_CHECKLIST.md includes inline sample text
- Tests create ad-hoc test data
- No shared test document repository

**Gap:** Inconsistent test data makes it hard to compare results across test runs.

**Impact:**
- Difficult to reproduce bugs
- Can't benchmark improvements
- Manual testing is inconsistent

**Recommendation:**
- Create test-data/ directory with standard test documents
- Define test data in specs: "Test Document A: 10 pages, 500 words, clean formatting"
- Include expected outputs for each test document
- Version control test data

### 6. Performance Requirements Lack Context

**Issue:** Performance targets don't specify conditions.

**Requirement 6.1:**
"WHEN a 30-page PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 30 seconds"

**Missing Context:**
- What's the network latency assumption?
- What's the LLM API response time assumption?
- Is this P50, P95, or P99?
- What happens if GLM API is slow?

**Impact:** Requirement might be impossible to meet under certain conditions.

**Recommendation:**
- Specify performance percentiles (P95 < 30s)
- Document assumptions (e.g., "assuming GLM API < 5s response time")
- Add degradation strategy (e.g., "if > 30s, show progress indicator")

## Gaps Between Specs and Implementation

### 1. Queue Management

**Spec:** Tasks 5-6 describe comprehensive queue system with PostgreSQL SKIP LOCKED

**Implementation:** MVP uses synchronous processing, no queue

**Status:** Intentionally deferred (documented in tasks-mvp.md)

**Risk:** Low (MVP scope decision)

### 2. Rate Limiting

**Spec:** Requirement 8 describes cooldown periods and anti-abuse measures

**Implementation:** Not implemented in MVP

**Status:** Deferred

**Risk:** Medium (could impact costs if abused)

**Recommendation:** Add basic rate limiting before public launch

### 3. Storage Cleanup

**Spec:** Requirement 7.2 requires 24-hour auto-deletion

**Implementation:** Cleanup functions exist but cron jobs not configured

**Status:** Partially implemented

**Risk:** Medium (storage costs could accumulate)

**Recommendation:** Configure cron jobs or add manual cleanup script

### 4. Observability

**Spec:** Requirement 9 describes comprehensive metrics logging

**Implementation:** Basic logging exists, no dashboard

**Status:** Partially implemented

**Risk:** Low for MVP, High for production

**Recommendation:** Add basic metrics dashboard before scaling

### 5. Text Cleaning Metrics

**Spec:** Design includes cleaning_metrics table for monitoring cleaning effectiveness

**Implementation:** Table exists but not populated

**Status:** Partially implemented

**Risk:** Low (nice-to-have for optimization)

**Recommendation:** Add metrics logging when optimizing cleaning patterns

## Architectural Observations

### Strengths

1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**
   - Frontend: Vue 3 + Composition API
   - Backend: Supabase Edge Functions
   - AI: Modular agent architecture

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript throughout
   - Shared types between frontend/backend
   - Strong typing in LLM service

3. **Testability**
   - Composables are pure functions
   - Agents are independently testable
   - E2E tests cover critical paths

### Concerns

1. **Synchronous Processing Bottleneck**
   - Current MVP blocks during processing
   - No way to handle multiple concurrent users
   - Could timeout on large documents

   **Recommendation:** Implement queue system (Task 5) before public launch

2. **No Authentication**
   - Specs assume Supabase auth
   - Implementation doesn't enforce it
   - RLS policies exist but not tested

   **Recommendation:** Add auth requirement to MVP or document as "local-only"

3. **Hard-Coded Configuration**
   - Some limits are hard-coded (40 words, file size)
   - Should be environment variables

   **Recommendation:** Move all limits to env vars

4. **Missing Monitoring**
   - No way to track LLM costs in real-time
   - No alerts for failures
   - No performance dashboards

   **Recommendation:** Add basic monitoring before production

2. MVP scoping is critical - tasks-mvp.md prevented over-engineering
3. Architecture decisions need documentation - ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md was valuable
4. Living documents - Specs should be updated as implementation evolves

### Technical

1. Traditional solutions often beat AI - Regex cleaning was the right choice
2. Type safety pays off - TypeScript caught many bugs early
3. Composition API enables modularity - Composables made code reusable
