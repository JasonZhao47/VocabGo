# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying VocabGo to Vercel. VocabGo is a Vue 3 + TypeScript application with a Supabase backend that needs to be deployed to Vercel's platform for production hosting. The deployment must ensure proper environment variable configuration, build optimization, and seamless integration with the existing Supabase infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **Vercel**: Cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions
- **VocabGo_Frontend**: The Vue 3 application that users interact with
- **Supabase_Backend**: The backend infrastructure including database, storage, and edge functions
- **Build_Process**: The compilation and optimization of Vue application for production
- **Environment_Variables**: Configuration values needed at build time and runtime
- **Deployment_Pipeline**: The automated process of building and deploying code changes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Vercel Project Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a Vercel project for VocabGo, so that I can deploy the application to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a new Vercel project, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL link to the GitHub repository
2. WHEN the project is created, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL detect the Vue framework automatically
3. WHEN the project is configured, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL use pnpm as the package manager
4. WHERE the build command is specified, THE Build_Process SHALL execute "pnpm build"
5. WHERE the output directory is specified, THE Build_Process SHALL use "dist" as the output directory

### Requirement 2: Environment Variable Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure environment variables in Vercel, so that the application can connect to Supabase services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are added, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL store VITE_SUPABASE_URL securely
2. WHEN environment variables are added, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL store VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY securely
3. WHEN the application builds, THE Build_Process SHALL inject environment variables at build time
4. WHERE environment variables are missing, THE Build_Process SHALL fail with a clear error message
5. WHEN environment variables are updated, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL require redeployment to take effect

### Requirement 3: Build Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be optimized, so that deployment is fast and the application performs well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build starts, THE Build_Process SHALL run TypeScript type checking
2. WHEN the build completes, THE Build_Process SHALL generate optimized production assets
3. WHEN assets are generated, THE Build_Process SHALL apply code splitting for optimal loading
4. WHEN CSS is processed, THE Build_Process SHALL minify and optimize stylesheets
5. WHEN the build succeeds, THE Build_Process SHALL output bundle size statistics

### Requirement 4: Deployment Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic deployments on git push, so that changes are deployed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL trigger a production deployment
2. WHEN code is pushed to other branches, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL create preview deployments
3. WHEN a deployment starts, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL run the build process
4. IF the build fails, THEN THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL prevent deployment and notify the developer
5. WHEN a deployment succeeds, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL make the new version live

### Requirement 5: Custom Domain Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure a custom domain, so that users can access the application at a branded URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE a custom domain is added, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL provide DNS configuration instructions
2. WHEN DNS is configured, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL verify domain ownership
3. WHEN domain is verified, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL provision SSL certificates automatically
4. WHEN SSL is provisioned, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL redirect HTTP to HTTPS
5. WHEN the domain is active, THE VocabGo_Frontend SHALL be accessible via the custom domain

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor application performance, so that I can identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment completes, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL run Lighthouse performance audits
2. WHEN users access the application, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL collect Web Vitals metrics
3. WHEN metrics are collected, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL display performance scores in the dashboard
4. WHERE performance degrades, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL alert developers
5. WHEN viewing analytics, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL show real user monitoring data

### Requirement 7: Rollback Capability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to rollback to previous deployments, so that I can quickly recover from issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment has issues, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL allow instant rollback to previous versions
2. WHEN rollback is initiated, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL switch traffic to the selected deployment
3. WHEN rollback completes, THE VocabGo_Frontend SHALL serve the previous version
4. WHERE multiple deployments exist, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL maintain deployment history
5. WHEN viewing deployments, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL show deployment status and timestamps

### Requirement 8: Preview Deployments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want preview deployments for pull requests, so that I can test changes before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL create a preview deployment
2. WHEN a preview is created, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL generate a unique URL
3. WHEN the pull request is updated, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL update the preview deployment
4. WHERE the pull request is merged, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL delete the preview deployment
5. WHEN viewing a pull request, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL add deployment status comments

### Requirement 9: Build Cache Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build caching enabled, so that deployments are faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build runs, THE Build_Process SHALL cache node_modules dependencies
2. WHEN dependencies are unchanged, THE Build_Process SHALL reuse cached dependencies
3. WHEN the build cache is used, THE Build_Process SHALL reduce build time significantly
4. WHERE cache is invalid, THE Build_Process SHALL rebuild from scratch
5. WHEN viewing build logs, THE Build_Process SHALL indicate cache hit or miss

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging, so that I can debug deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build fails, THE Build_Process SHALL output detailed error messages
2. WHEN a deployment fails, THE Deployment_Pipeline SHALL preserve error logs
3. WHEN viewing logs, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL provide searchable build and runtime logs
4. WHERE errors occur, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL highlight error lines in logs
5. WHEN debugging, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL provide log streaming in real-time
