2. âœ… Dev server is running: `pnpm dev`
3. âœ… Browser DevTools is open (F12 or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
4. âœ… Network tab is visible in DevTools

## Test Setup

1. **Start Supabase** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   supabase start
   ```

2. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Open the app** in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Task 6.1: Manual Test - Fetch Wordlists

**Objective**: Verify that fetching wordlists includes the Authorization header

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Saved Wordlists page**:
   - Click "View Saved Wordlists" from the home page
   - OR navigate directly to: `http://localhost:5173/wordlists`

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for a request to: `fetch-wordlists`

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing authorization header" error
**Solution**: 
- Verify `.env.local` has the correct `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Restart the dev server after changing environment variables
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Network request not showing in DevTools
**Solution**:
- Ensure "Preserve log" is enabled in Network tab
- Try clearing the network log and repeating the action
- Check if the request is being filtered (show "All" requests)

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**:
- Ensure Supabase is running: `supabase status`
- Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` is set to `http://localhost:54321`
- Restart both Supabase and the dev server

### Issue: Processing takes too long or times out
**Solution**:
- Check that GLM API key is configured in Supabase secrets
- Use a smaller test document (< 5 pages)
- Check Supabase logs: `supabase functions logs process-document`

### Issue: Empty wordlists page
**Solution**:
- This is expected if you haven't saved any wordlists yet
- Complete Task 6.2 first to create a saved wordlist
- Check browser console for any errors

## Verification Checklist

After completing all tests, verify:

- [ ] âœ… All 4 edge function calls include Authorization header
- [ ] âœ… Fetch wordlists works without errors
- [ ] âœ… Save wordlist works and persists data
- [ ] âœ… Delete wordlist works and removes data
- [ ] âœ… Process document works and generates wordlist
- [ ] âœ… No console errors during any operation
- [ ] âœ… All network requests return 200 OK status
- [ ] âœ… UI feedback is appropriate for all actions

---

## Next Steps

Once all tests pass:
1. Mark tasks 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 as complete in `tasks.md`
2. Document any issues found in a bug report
3. If all tests pass, the Authorization header fix is complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

- All tests should be performed with DevTools Network tab open
- Take screenshots of successful requests if needed for documentation
- If any test fails, note the specific error message and request details
- The Authorization header should be identical to the apikey value
