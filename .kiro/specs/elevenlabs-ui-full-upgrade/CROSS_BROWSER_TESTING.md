## Common Issues to Watch For

### Font Loading
- **FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text)**: Waldenburg loads with `font-display: swap`
- **Fallback fonts**: System fonts should provide good fallback
- **Font weight variations**: Ensure 400 and 700 weights load correctly

### CSS Compatibility
- **Flexbox**: Older Safari versions had bugs (should be fine in latest)
- **Grid**: Check IE11 if needed (not in scope for latest browsers)
- **Custom properties**: CSS variables work in all modern browsers
- **Backdrop-filter**: May not work in older Firefox

### Animation Performance
- **60fps target**: Monitor frame rates during animations
- **GPU acceleration**: Ensure transform/opacity are used
- **Reduced motion**: Test with prefers-reduced-motion enabled

### Form Controls
- **Autofill styling**: Browser default autofill colors
- **Focus rings**: Different browsers have different defaults
- **Placeholder opacity**: May vary between browsers

### Responsive Behavior
- **Viewport units**: iOS Safari vh issues
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px on mobile
- **Hover on touch**: Hover states on touch devices

## Testing Methodology

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Open each page in each browser
   - Compare side-by-side with design mockups
   - Check for visual inconsistencies

2. **Interaction Testing**
   - Click all buttons and links
   - Fill out all forms
   - Test hover states
   - Test keyboard navigation

3. **Responsive Testing**
   - Resize browser window
   - Test at 375px, 768px, 1440px
   - Use browser DevTools device emulation

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Check animation smoothness
   - Monitor frame rates
   - Test on slower devices

5. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Navigate with keyboard only
   - Test with screen reader
   - Check focus indicators
   - Test with reduced motion

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run cross-browser tests
pnpm test tests/cross-browser/

# Run accessibility tests
pnpm test tests/accessibility/

# Run responsive tests
pnpm test tests/responsive/
```

## Browser-Specific Fixes

### If Issues Are Found

#### Safari-Specific Fixes
```css
/* Example: Fix iOS input zoom */
@supports (-webkit-touch-callout: none) {
  input, textarea, select {
    font-size: 16px; /* Prevent zoom on focus */
  }
}
```

#### Firefox-Specific Fixes
```css
/* Example: Fix Firefox focus outline */
@-moz-document url-prefix() {
  button:focus-visible {
    outline: 2px solid black;
