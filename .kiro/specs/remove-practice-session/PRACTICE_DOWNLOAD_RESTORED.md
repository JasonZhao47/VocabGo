# Practice Question Download Feature - RESTORED

## Issue Identified
The practice session removal spec incorrectly removed the **practice question download functionality**, which was supposed to be preserved according to Requirement 2 in the spec.

## What Was Restored

### 1. HTML Generator Service
**File:** `src/services/practiceHtmlGenerator.ts`
- Generates self-contained HTML files with practice questions
- Includes all CSS and JavaScript inline (no external dependencies)
- Supports matching, fill-blank, and multiple-choice questions
- ElevenLabs-inspired design with dark/light mode support
- Interactive functionality that works completely offline

### 2. Practice Questions Composable
**File:** `src/composables/usePracticeQuestions.ts`
- Handles practice question generation API calls
- Transforms question data for HTML generator
- Manages loading states and error handling
- Downloads generated HTML files via browser download API

### 3. Updated SavedWordlistsPage
**File:** `src/pages/SavedWordlistsPage.vue`
- **Practice Questions button is now FUNCTIONAL** (was disabled)
- Button generates and downloads HTML practice files
- Shows loading state during generation
- Maintains ElevenLabs styling and UX patterns
- Proper error handling with toast notifications

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Practice Questions" button** on a wordlist card
2. **System generates practice questions** via Edge Function API call
3. **Questions are transformed** to HTML generator format
4. **HTML file is generated** with embedded CSS/JS
5. **File is downloaded** to user's device
6. **User can practice offline** by opening the HTML file

## Button Behavior

### Before (Broken)
```vue
<button disabled title="Practice session feature has been removed">
  Practice Questions
</button>
```

### After (Working)
```vue
<button 
  @click="generateAndDownload(wordlist)"
  :disabled="wordlist.wordCount < 4 || isGenerating"
  :title="wordlist.wordCount < 4 ? 'Minimum 4 words required' : 'Generate and download practice questions'"
>
  {{ isGenerating ? 'Generating...' : 'Practice Questions' }}
</button>
```

## Features Restored

- Cross-browser compatibility

### ✅ User Experience
- Loading states with spinner animation
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Proper button states (enabled/disabled)
- Tooltips for user guidance
- Maintains ElevenLabs design consistency

- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions

### API Integration
- Uses existing `generate-practice-questions` Edge Function
- Maintains session-based authentication
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Respects rate limiting and timeout constraints

## Testing Status

### ✅ Build Verification
- TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**
- Production build: **PASSED**
- No type errors or build warnings

### ⚠️ Manual Testing Required
To fully verify functionality:
1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Upload a document with 4+ words
3. Save the wordlist
4. Click "Practice Questions" button
5. Verify HTML file downloads
6. Open HTML file and test interactivity

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirement 2: Preserve Practice Question Buttons
