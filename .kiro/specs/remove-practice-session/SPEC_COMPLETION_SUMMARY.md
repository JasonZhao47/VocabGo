## Design Requirements Met

### ElevenLabs Aesthetics (Requirement 5)
- ✅ 5.1: Cards use rounded-2xl borders with shadow effects
- ✅ 5.2: Buttons use rounded-full styling with smooth transitions
- ✅ 5.3: Spacing follows 8px grid system (gap-2, gap-4, p-6)
- ✅ 5.4: Hover effects with subtle feedback (hover:bg-gray-50, transition-colors duration-150)
- ✅ 5.5: Typography uses established sizes ([14px], [15px], [18px], [20px]) and weights

### Button Styling Standards
**Primary Button (View):**
```css
w-full h-10 px-4 text-[14px] font-semibold text-white bg-black rounded-full 
hover:bg-gray-800 transition-colors duration-150
```

**Secondary Button (Practice, Export):**
```css
w-full h-10 px-4 text-[14px] font-semibold text-black bg-white border border-gray-200 
rounded-full hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-150 
disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed
```

**Destructive Button (Delete):**
```css
flex-1 h-10 px-4 text-[14px] font-semibold text-red-600 bg-white border border-red-200 
rounded-full hover:bg-red-50 transition-colors duration-150
```

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

1. ✅ Practice page route is removed/redirects to wordlists
2. ✅ All practice session components are deleted
3. ✅ SavedWordlistsPage renders without errors
4. ✅ "Practice Questions" button maintains ElevenLabs styling
