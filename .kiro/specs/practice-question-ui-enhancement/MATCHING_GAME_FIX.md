# Matching Game Interactive Fix

## Problem
The matching game in downloaded HTML files was non-functional - there was no click-to-connect interaction, making it impossible for users to match word pairs.

## Solution
Implemented a complete click-to-connect system with ElevenLabs-inspired design patterns:

### Interactive Features Added

1. **Click-to-Connect Logic**
   - Click an English word to select it
   - Click a Mandarin translation to select it
   - When both are selected, automatically check if they match
   - Correct matches are locked in with green styling
   - Incorrect matches show red error animation and reset

2. **Visual Feedback (ElevenLabs Style)**
   - **Hover**: Border darkens, background lightens, subtle lift effect
   - **Selected**: Black border with shadow ring effect
   - **Matched**: Green border, light green background, reduced opacity
   - **Incorrect**: Red border, red background, shake animation

3. **State Management**
   - Tracks selected English and Mandarin items
   - Stores completed matches
   - Prevents interaction with already-matched items
   - Calculates score based on correct matches

### CSS Enhancements

```css
.matching-item:hover:not(.matched) {
  border-color: #9ca3af;
  background: #f9fafb;
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}

.matching-item.selected {
  border-color: #000000;
  background: #f3f4f6;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.matching-item.matched {
  border-color: #10b981;
  background: #ecfdf5;
  cursor: default;
  opacity: 0.7;
}

.matching-item.incorrect {
  border-color: #ef4444;
  background: #fef2f2;
  animation: shake 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

### JavaScript Functions Added

1. **`selectMatchingItem(questionIndex, side, value)`**
   - Handles click events on matching items
   - Manages selection state
   - Triggers match checking when both sides selected

2. **`checkMatch(questionIndex)`**
   - Validates if selected pair is correct
   - Applies appropriate styling (matched/incorrect)
   - Updates state with successful matches
   - Resets selections after incorrect attempts

3. **Score Calculation**
   - Updated to count matching questions correctly
   - Checks if all pairs have been matched

## Testing

A test file `test-matching.html` has been created to verify the functionality:
- Open the file in a browser
- Click English words and Mandarin translations to match them
- Correct matches turn green and lock in place
- Incorrect matches shake and reset
- Submit to see your score

## User Experience

The matching game now provides:
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Smooth animations following ElevenLabs design principles
- Intuitive click-to-connect workflow
- Immediate feedback on correct/incorrect matches
- Professional, polished appearance

## Files Modified

- `src/services/htmlGenerationService.ts` - Added interactive matching logic and enhanced CSS
- `test-matching.html` - Created standalone test file

## Next Steps

Users can now:
1. Download practice sets with matching questions
2. Open the HTML file in any browser
3. Click to match English words with Mandarin translations
4. Get immediate visual feedback
5. See their final score

The matching game is fully functional and follows the ElevenLabs design system for consistency with the rest of the application.
