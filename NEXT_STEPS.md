# What to Do Next

**Your codebase is now 44% simpler!** Here's what to do next.

---

## ✅ What's Done

- Database simplified (4 tables → 1 table)
- XLSX export removed (CSV only)
- Over-engineered infrastructure removed
- TypeScript compiles successfully
- Supabase running successfully
- All migrations applied

---

## 🧪 Manual Testing (Do This Now)

### 1. Start the Frontend

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

### 2. Test Core Features

**Upload & Process:**
1. Upload a test document (PDF, TXT, DOCX, or XLSX)
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Verify wordlist appears (up to 40 words)
4. Check English and Mandarin translations

**Save Wordlist:**
1. Click "Save to My Wordlists"
2. Verify success message appears

**View Saved Wordlists:**
1. Navigate to "Saved Wordlists" page
2. Verify your saved wordlist appears
3. Click on it to view details

**Export CSV:**
1. Click "Export CSV" button
2. Verify CSV file downloads
3. Open in Excel/Google Sheets
4. Check Mandarin characters display correctly

**Delete Wordlist:**
1. Click "Delete" button
2. Confirm deletion
3. Verify wordlist is removed

### 3. Expected Results

✅ All features work
✅ No XLSX export button (removed)
✅ CSV export works perfectly
✅ No errors in browser console
✅ No TypeScript errors

## 📝 Update Documentation (Optional)

If you want to update docs to reflect simplifications:

### Files to Update

1. **README.md**
   - Remove mentions of XLSX export
   - Update architecture diagram (if any)
   - Simplify feature list

2. **design.md**
   - Add note about MVP simplifications
   - Remove queue system details
   - Remove metrics tracking details

3. **QUICKSTART.md**
   - Already good, no changes needed

---

## 🚀 Deploy to Production (When Ready)

### Prerequisites
- Manual testing complete
- All features working
- No critical bugs

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Simplify codebase: remove over-engineered features"

# 2. Push to repository
git push origin main

# 3. Deploy database migrations
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
supabase db push

# 4. Deploy Edge Functions
supabase functions deploy process-document
supabase functions deploy save-wordlist
supabase functions deploy fetch-wordlists
supabase functions deploy delete-wordlist

# 5. Deploy frontend (depends on your hosting)
pnpm build
# Upload dist/ to your hosting provider
```

## 👥 Get Your First 10 Users

### Where to Find Users

1. **Friends & Family**
   - Ask English learners you know
   - Get honest feedback

2. **Online Communities**
   - Reddit: r/languagelearning, r/ChineseLanguage
   - Facebook groups for English learners
   - Discord servers for language learning

3. **Social Media**
   - Twitter/X: Post about your tool
   - LinkedIn: Share with your network
   - Instagram: Visual demo of the tool

### What to Ask Users

1. **Is it useful?**
   - Would you use this regularly?
   - What would make it more useful?

2. **What's missing?**
   - What features do you need?
   - What's confusing or unclear?

3. **Export format?**
   - Is CSV enough?
   - Do you need XLSX? (if 3+ say yes, add it back)

## 🔄 When to Add Complexity Back

### XLSX Export
**Add when:** 3+ users request it  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**How:** Restore code from git history, add xlsx library

### Queue System
**Add when:** 50+ concurrent users  
**Effort:** 1-2 days  
**How:** Implement Task 5 from original tasks.md

### Metrics Dashboard
**Add when:** LLM costs > $100/month  
**Effort:** 2-3 days  
**How:** Create admin UI, populate metrics table

### Rate Limiting
**Add when:** First abuse incident  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**How:** Add per-IP rate limiting with Redis

## 📊 What to Measure

### User Metrics
- How many users sign up?
- How many upload documents?
- How many save wordlists?
- How many export wordlists?

### Technical Metrics
- Average processing time
- LLM API costs
- Error rates
- Storage usage

### Feedback Metrics
- What features do users request?
- What problems do they encounter?
- What do they love?
- What do they hate?

## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### Rollback Database

```bash
# Remove simplification migration
rm supabase/migrations/20250109000000_simplify_schema.sql

# Reset database
supabase db reset
```

### Rollback Code

```bash
# Restore XLSX export
git checkout HEAD~1 src/services/wordlistService.ts
git checkout HEAD~1 src/composables/useWordlist.ts
git checkout HEAD~1 src/pages/ResultPage.vue
git checkout HEAD~1 src/pages/SavedWordlistsPage.vue
```

### Get Help

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs: `supabase functions logs process-document`
3. Check database: `supabase db diff`
4. Review SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md for what changed
